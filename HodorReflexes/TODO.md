# TODO

## priority high:
- share ult no longer as % but as ult number instead. ( this does not mean its not displayed as percent anymore, just that the sharing is using total ult numbers)
  - add attro ult
  - add barrier ult

## priority mid:
- integrity checks

## priority low:
- none atm

## just thoughts:
- adding Hodor icons to RectOver TargetFrame instead of CP symbol ???
- keybind to toggle sharing colossus and horn
