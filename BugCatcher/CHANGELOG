Created a patched version of Werewolf Finds Dragon's BugCatcher addon for Harrowstorm.
[LIST]
[*]  [COLOR="MediumSeaGreen"]Breaking Change[/COLOR]Removed the common embedded libraries so it now requires that the LibAddonMenu-2.0 addon be installed separately.
[*] It has also been changed to address sirinsidiator's concern about firing the "LAM-RefreshPanel" callback too often.
[*] The utility files including the lua .exe and dll files have been removed, because they are available from the original version - and elsewhere online - and I personally don't like pulling down opaque executables anyway.
