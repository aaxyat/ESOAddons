     Known issues:

	   - Cast cancels are not currently tracked, and GCD reset tracking does not work whilst heavy attack + cast timing is enabled
	   - Early finish / cancelled heavy attacks do not reset the swing bar
?  This is a test build - I don't have enough characters and spells 
   unlocked to be able to fully test this (I haven't tested channeling
   at all because I don't have any channeled spells unlocked xD)
   So anyone willing to try things out and report issues would be greatly appreciated.
