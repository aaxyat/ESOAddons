;   immediately tradeable

;   show an additional tooltip for the collectible itself
; * Updated French localization by @XXXspartiateXXX
;
; Version 4.5.2 (2022/04/28)
; * Players can now optionally supply the /linktrade chat command with the
;   "uncollected" (or "u") parameter to include items that are uncollected by

; * API version bump for Update 34 (High Isle)
;
; Version 4.5.0 (2022/04/09)

;   rewards collected during the current event day
;
; Version 4.4.6 (2022/03/31)
; * Fixed a Lua error that arose when LibMultiAccountCollectibles is present,
;   but LibMultiAccountSets is not
;
; Version 4.4.5 (2022/03/30)
; * Updated French localization by @jakez31
;
; Version 4.4.4 (2022/03/29)
; * Added support for the new universal deconstruction panel
;
; Version 4.4.3 (2022/03/22)
; * Fixed a typo that caused the LibMultiAccountCollectibles integration to
;   incorrectly consider bound style pages and runeboxes as tradeable
;
; Version 4.4.2 (2022/03/18)
; * Added description text for the setting introduced in version 4.4.1
;
; Version 4.4.1 (2022/03/16)
; * Added an option to disable LibCharacterKnowledge support to the Loot Log
;   addon settings panel
;
; Version 4.4.0 (2022/03/09)
; * Added LibMultiAccountCollectibles as an optional library dependency
;
; Version 4.3.2 (2022/02/23)
; * The more prominent link to the chat commands reference will now be hidden
;   for players who have already discovered the features whose discoverability
;   the link was intended to improve
;
; Versions 4.3.0 to 4.3.1 (2022/02/19)
; * /binduncollected can now be used to automatically bind uncollected set items
;   for a period of time by specifying a time parameter (in minutes); for
;   example, "/bu 120" will cause Loot Log to automatically bind all uncollected
;   set items for the next 120 minutes, and "/bu 0" will cancel automatic
;   binding
;   - This feature was added in response to item set curation; originally, there
;     was no reason for players to bind items immediately, and most players
;     would bind items in a single large batch at the end of their activities,
;     but as curation encourages players to bind items frequently in order to
;     avoid repeats, it has become necessary to support this new usage pattern
; * /binduncollected will now ignore items that have been locked by the player
; * The /bunc shorthand, which was deprecated a year ago, has been removed;
;   users who wish to use a shorthand version of /binduncollected should use /bu
; * Added a new link to the chat commands reference to the footer of the Loot
;   History Browser, in an effort to improve the discoverability of the
;   /binduncollected and /linktrade features
;
; Version 4.2.0 (2022/02/17)
; * The "-" prefix can now be used in the search filter to exclude a search term
;
; Version 4.1.1 (2021/09/28)
; * Blue-quality companion items will no longer be considered notable
;
; Version 4.1.0 (2021/08/07)
; * The item request link for uncollected items linked by other players will now
;   appear as a "[++]" before the message
;   - This change was made to mitigate the problems with link positions becoming
;     desynced at the end of a long message
;   - Players can revert to the original behavior of placing the request link at
;     the end of the message via the Loot Log addon settings panel
;
; Version 4.0.11 (2021/08/02)
; * Fixed an issue where the "High" and "Low" text in the settings were changed
;   as a result of ZOS changing the text associated with SI_HIGH and SI_LOW
; * /linktrade will now ignore items that have been locked by the player
;
; Version 4.0.10 (2021/07/17)
; * Added an option to change the position of the request link for uncollected
;   items linked by other players, which may help mitigate issues of desyncs
;   between mouse clicks and link positions
; * Added an option to use a static color instead of randomized colors for the
;   names of the recipients in loot notifications in chat
;
; Version 4.0.9 (2021/06/08)
; * Companion items of blue quality or higher will now be considered notable
;
; Version 4.0.8 (2021/05/12)
; * Improved the handling of tooltips for antiquity items
;
; Version 4.0.7 (2021/05/03)
; * Updated the integration with the Character Knowledge addon; the flagging of
;   unknown recipes, plans, or motifs now requires Character Knowledge version
;   1.2.1 or newer
;
; Version 4.0.6 (2021/04/30)
; * Updated French localization by @jakez31
;
; Version 4.0.5 (2021/03/28)
; * /linktrade will now relink items that had been previously linked if the
;   player acquires a new copy of that item
;
; Version 4.0.4 (2021/03/23)
; * /linktrade will now skip over BoP items that are not eligible for trade with
;   any members of the current group; this check is bypassed if the optional
;   "all" flag is used or if the player is not currently grouped inside a
;   dungeon, trial, or arena
; * Fixed a typo with the optional "e" flag for /linktrade
;
; Version 4.0.3 (2021/03/20)
; * Updated Russian localization by @mychaelo
;
; Version 4.0.2 (2021/03/16)
; * It is now possible to assign keybinds for /linktrade and /binduncollected
; * It is now possible to invoke /linktrade and /binduncollected from the
;   button strip at the bottom of the screen when the Loot History Browser
;   is open
; * The shortened version of /binduncollected has been changed from /bunc to
;   /bu (/bunc will continue to function as well, but will be eventually
;   disabled in the future)
; * The "reset" parameter for /linktrade now has a shortened version: "r"
; * It is now possible to combine the "reset" parameter with other parameters
;   when using /linktrade; for example, "/lt w r" will link surplus weapons,
;   relinking any that had already been previously linked
; * Added a chat commands reference, accessible via the button strip at the
;   bottom of the screen when the Loot History Browser is open
;
; Version 4.0.1 (2021/02/28)
; * It is now possible for external addons to add context menu items to this
;   addon's browser UI
; * LibExtendedJournal updated to version 1.1.0
;
; Version 4.0.0 (2021/02/25)
; * Internal code restructuring; this addon is now part of the Extended Journal
; * Added integration with the Character Knowledge addon
;
; Version 3.6.6 (2021/01/19)
; * Improved handling of the collection state of collectible fragments
; * Updated Russian localization by @mychaelo
;
; Version 3.6.5 (2021/01/15)
; * The /linktrade chat command will now automatically link any remaining items
;   after the current message is sent, if the number of tradeable items to link
;   exceed the message limit, thus eliminating the need to manually reinvoke the
;   command
;
; Versions 3.6.3 to 3.6.4 (2021/01/14)
; * Added visual previews of the uncollected indicators to the Loot Log addon
;   settings panel
; * The "Show only uncollected items" filter in the Loot History browser will no
;   longer show items that are flagged for accounts with lower priority than the
;   current account when the optional multi-account mode is enabled
;
; Version 3.6.2 (2021/01/13)
; * The behavior of the optional multi-account mode has been changed so that
;   priority-based icons and colors will be used only for items that are not
;   intended for collection by the current account (i.e., items that are
;   uncollected by another higher-priority account or items that are already
;   collected by the current account); this should result in a more coherent
;   flagging ruleset when the optional multi-account mode is enabled
;
; Version 3.6.1 (2021/01/11)
; * Players can now optionally supply the /linktrade chat command with the "wep"
;   (or "w") parameter to link only BoP weapons, to reduce the amount of "noise"
;   if everyone in a trial or group dungeon has already collected all of the
;   easier-to-acquire body and jewelry pieces
;
; Version 3.6.0 (2021/01/09)
; * Updated iconography for the uncollected indicators
; * Uncollected items attached to mails will now be flagged if "Flag uncollected
;   items in item lists" is enabled
;
; Version 3.5.4 (2021/01/06)
; * Updated French localization by @jakez31
;
; Versions 3.5.2 to 3.5.3 (2021/01/04)
; * Players can now optionally supply the /binduncollected chat command with the
;   "junk" (or "j") parameter to mark any items that are bound by the command as
;   junk, so that the items can be easily identified for later disposal
;   - Examples: /binduncollected junk or /bunc j
; * If the optional multi-account support is enabled and the current account's
;   priority is set to "Off", then the /binduncollected chat command will no
;   longer bind any BoE items, as an additional safeguard against mule accounts
;   binding the gear that they are storing
;
; Version 3.5.1 (2021/01/01)
; * Fixed a settings-related Lua error introduced in version 3.5.0
;
; Version 3.5.0 (2021/01/01)
; * For players with multiple accounts, Loot Log can now flag uncollected set
;   items based on the set collections of other accounts; this feature is
;   disabled by default and can be enabled via the Loot Log addon settings panel
;   - Note: This option will be visible only if LibMultiAccountSets 1.7 or newer
;     is installed and there is item set collection data for at least two
;     different accounts
; * Players can now optionally supply the /linktrade chat command with the "boe"
;   (or "e"), "bop" (or "p"), or "all" (or "a") parameters to link only BoE,
;   only BoP, or all items, allowing users to temporarily bypass the current
;   /linktrade settings
;   - Examples: /linktrade boe or /lt a
;
; Version 3.4.0 (2020/12/28)
; * New feature: Flag uncollected items in item lists: Loot Log will now flag
;   uncollected collectible items (i.e., set items, style pages, and runeboxes)
;   in various in-game item lists (which include player inventory, banks, vendor
;   inventory, and loot windows); this feature can be configured (or disabled)
;   via the Loot Log addon settings panel
;
; Version 3.3.0 (2020/12/23)
; * Removed the quantity column from the Loot History browser; entries that have
;   a quantity greater than one will have the quantity displayed in front of the
;   item
;
; Versions 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 (2020/12/21)
; * After using the /binduncollected chat command to bind uncollected set items,
;   players are presented with the option to view a report listing the items
;   that were bound
; * When scanning incoming chat messages to flag uncollected items linked by
;   other players, Loot Log will no longer flag an uncollected item if an
;   "unused" copy of that item is currently in the player's inventory or bank
; * Improved the clarity of some of the wording in the Loot Log addon settings
;   panel
;
; Version 3.2.0 (2020/12/20)
; * New feature: /binduncollected chat command: Players can use the
;   /binduncollected (or /bunc) chat command to bind the first copy of every
;   uncollected set item in their character's inventory
; * The /linktrade reset command is now more discoverable
;
; Version 3.1.0 (2020/12/17)
; * If "Flag uncollected items linked by others" is enabled, Loot Log will now
;   append a link to the end of messages containing uncollected items that, when
;   clicked, will initiate a whisper with the message sender, requesting the
;   uncollected items in that message; this feature can be configured (or
;   disabled) via the Loot Log addon settings panel
; * /linktrade will now switch chat to the group channel if the player is
;   currently grouped inside a dungeon, trial, or arena
; * Reduced the /linktrade relinking cooldown from 75 to 60 minutes
; * Fixed a potential Lua error with the processing of incoming chat messages
;
; Version 3.0.0 (2020/12/16)
; * New feature: Flag uncollected items linked by others: Loot Log will now flag
;   unbound uncollected collectible items (i.e., set items, style pages, and
;   runeboxes) that other players have linked in chat; this feature can be
;   configured (or disabled) via the Loot Log addon settings panel
; * New feature: /linktrade chat command: Players can use the /linktrade (or
;   /lt) chat command to link in chat their tradeable set items (items needed
;   for the player's own collection will be excluded), with intelligent handling
;   of duplicate items; by default, this feature will only link BoP-tradeable
;   items, but it can be configured to include BoE items via the Loot Log addon
;   settings panel
;

; * Updated Russian localization by @mychaelo
